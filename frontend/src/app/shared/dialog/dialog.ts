/**
 * Modal Dialog Wrapper Component
 * 
 * Reusable modal dialog component providing a standard popup/modal interface
 * with smooth open/close animations. Used as a wrapper for other dialog
 * components like task dialogs and contact dialogs.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Configurable dialog width
 * - Smooth fade in/out animations (400ms duration)
 * - Click-outside-to-close functionality
 * - Prevents multiple close actions
 * - Emits closed event when dialog is fully closed
 * - Used for overlays and modal presentations
 * 
 * Animation States:
 * - Open: Dialog displayed with animation
 * - Closing: Transition state during close animation
 * - Closed: Dialog hidden and removed from display
 * 
 * @component
 * @selector app-dialog
 * @standalone true
 * 
 * @example
 * <app-dialog #dialog (closed)="onDialogClosed()">
 *   Dialog content goes here
 * </app-dialog>
